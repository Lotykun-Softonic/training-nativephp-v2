# INSTRUCTIONS

## Consideration for understanding this document
- This document tires to guide you to set up a Laravel project with Sail and the prerequisites for mobile app development using Laravel.
- It is very important to distinguish between the commands executed in this document on your native machine and those commands that should be executed inside Docker.
    - Each command that is marked in this document with the icon `游릱` should be executed in your terminal or command prompt inside your `native machine`.
    - Each command that is marked in this document with the icon `游릴` should be executed in your terminal or command prompt inside the running Sail container.

## Prerequisites

## 游릱 Install Laravel
To install Laravel, you need to have [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) installed on your machine. Once Composer is installed, you can create a new Laravel project by running the following command in your terminal:

Replace `your-project-name` with the desired name of your project.
```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel your-project-name
```

## 游릱 Install Sail
Laravel Sail is a lightweight command-line interface for interacting with Laravel's default Docker development environment. To install Sail, navigate to your Laravel project directory and run the following command:

```bash
cd your-project-name
composer require laravel/sail --dev
php artisan sail:install
```

## 游릱 Start Laravel Sail
To start Laravel Sail, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
./vendor/bin/sail up
```
This command will start the Docker containers for your Laravel application. You can access your application at `http://localhost`. Depending on port configuration, you might need to access it via `http://localhost:8000` or another port specified in your `docker-compose.yml` file.

## 游릱 Connect to the running sail container
Replace `{CONTAINER_ID}` with the actual container ID of your running Sail container. You can find it by running the command `docker ps` in your terminal.

```bash
docker exec -it {CONTAINER_ID} bash 
```

## 游릴 Update dependencies
To ensure you have the latest dependencies, run the followings commands burt these commands should be executed `inside the running Sail container`.

### Update Composer dependencies
```bash
cd /var/www/html
composer update
```

### Update NPM dependencies
```bash
cd /var/www/html
npm update
```

## Check Laravel installation
To check if Laravel is installed correctly, you can go to your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost` or `http://localhost:8000` (depending on your port configuration). You should see the Laravel welcome page.

## 游릴 Install Laravel Tallstack
To install Laravel Tallstack, run the following commands `inside the running Sail container`:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
composer require livewire/livewire laravel-frontend-presets/tall
php artisan ui tall
npm install && npm run dev
```

## Check Laravel Tallstack installation
To check if Laravel Tallstack is installed correctly, you can go to your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost` or `http://localhost:8000` (depending on your port configuration). You should see the Laravel welcome page with Livewire and Tailwind CSS loaded.

## Install Flux
